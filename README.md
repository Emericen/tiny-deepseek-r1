# ✨ Tiny DeepSeek R1

This repo contains a minimal implementation of DeepSeek R1, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) to execute Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Supported models:
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B`
- `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B`

For more information, please refer to the [DeepSeek R1 Original Repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [DeepSeek R1 Report](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf).

# 🦋 Quick Start

I recommend installing torch with cuda enabled (see [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). After that, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can use the code base like the following:

```python
from model.model import DeepSeekR1Distilled, Processor

model_name = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B"
model = DeepSeekR1Distilled.from_pretrained(repo_id=model_name, device_map="auto")
processor = Processor(repo_id=model_name)

context = ["what is 55^0.12?"]
# right answer is 1.61749714485

inputs = processor(context, device="cuda")
output = model.generate(
    input_ids=inputs["input_ids"],
    max_new_tokens=128,
    temperature=0.6, 
    # recommended temperature between 0.5 and 0.8
)
output_text = processor.tokenizer.decode(output[0].tolist())
print(output_text)
```
Output (truncated):
```
Okay, so I need to figure out what 55 raised to the power of 0.12 is. Hmm, let's see. I remember that 
exponents can be a bit tricky, especially when they're not whole numbers. So, 0.12 is the same as 
12/100, which simplifies to 3/25. That means 55^(0.12) is the same as the 25th root of 55 cubed. Wait, 
is that right? Let me double-check. Yeah, because when you have a fractional exponent like a/b, it's 
the same as taking the bth root of a^a. So, 55^(3/25) is indeed the 25th root of 55 cubed.

But calculating the 25th root of something seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach 
this. I think using logarithms could help. If I take the natural logarithm of 55, multiply it by 0.12, 
and then exponentiate the result, that should give me the answer. Let me write that down:

ln(55) ≈ 4.007333146

Now, multiplying that by 0.12:

4.007333146 * 0.12 ≈ 0.48088

So, e^(0.48088) should be approximately equal to 55^0.12. Let me calculate e^0.48088. I know that 
e^0.4 is about 1.4918, and e^0.48 is roughly 1.6161. Since 0.48088 is just a bit more than 0.48, maybe 
around 1.617 or 1.618. Wait, that's close to the golden ratio, but I don't think that's relevant 
here. Let me use a calculator for a more precise value.

Alternatively, I could use the common logarithm instead. Let's try that. Log base 10 of 55 is 
approximately 1.7403627. Multiplying that by 0.12 gives:

1.7403627 * 0.12 ≈ 0.2088435

Now, 10 raised to the power of 0.2088435. I know that 10^0.2 is about 1.5849, and 10^0.2088435 should 
be slightly higher. Maybe around 1.616 or so. That seems consistent with the natural logarithm method.

Wait, both methods gave me approximately the same result, around 1.616. That makes me more confident 
that the answer is correct.
